Password Strength Analyzer is a Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter that evaluates the strength of user-provided passwords and provides real-time feedback.

Key Features:
- Strength scoring system based on length, character variety, and password patterns
- Visual feedback with a progress bar and strength labels (Very Weak â†’ Strong)
- Estimated crack time calculation using entropy and brute-force assumptions
- Security checks for common, sequential, or repeated characters
- Improvement suggestions to guide users toward stronger, more secure passwords
- User-friendly interface with password visibility toggle and real-time updates

Project Goals:
1. Promote cybersecurity awareness by showing how easily weak passwords can be cracked
2. Educate users with actionable suggestions for building stronger passwords
3. Practical learning of GUI development in Python and applying security best practices
4. Combine usability and security by making password analysis intuitive and interactive

This project reflects my interest in cybersecurity, usability, and secure software design, with a focus on educating users while building practical coding skills.
